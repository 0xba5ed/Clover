On 2016-1-17 Clover was suspended from Google Play, with the reason "Violation of the sexually explicit material provision of the Content Policy."

I made an appeal for this suspension, and that might take a few days to process. This happened about an hour after I uploaded the final beta to the Play Store, that had some changes to what top boards were displayed, and I think that triggered the suspension.

You can still get Clover through F-Droid and with the available APK downloads, I do however recommend F-Droid so that you still get automatic updates.

F-Droid (v2 should be up very soon): https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.floens.chan
