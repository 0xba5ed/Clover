On 2016-1-17 Clover was suspended from Google Play, with the reason "Violation of the sexually explicit material provision of the Content Policy."

I made an appeal for this suspension, and that might take a few days to process. This happened about an hour after I uploaded the final beta to the Play Store, that had some changes to what top boards were displayed, and I think that triggered the suspension.

You can still get Clover through F-Droid and with the available APK downloads, I do however recommend F-Droid so that you still get automatic updates.

F-Droid (v2 is up): https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=org.floens.chan
APKs: https://floens.github.io/Clover/#releases

UPDATE 2016-1-26:
I've written about the appeal denial here:

UPDATE 2016-1-29:
Clover is back up on Google Play
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.floens.clover

UPDATE 2016-2-1:
Clover has been suspended for the second time.
The reason this time is: "we have determined that your app or app listing links the user to a website with pornographic or sexual content."
This reason is very vague, and basically means that 4chan is just not allowed. Re-uploading will be useless because they're after me (Clover went unnoticed for years), so I'm not going to.
Life is unfair.
Clover will still be on F-Droid, and I recommend you get it from there so you will receive future updates. https://f-droid.org/app/org.floens.chan
